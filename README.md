Gilded Rose QA Assignment

This repository contains my manual QA materials for the Kotlin Gilded Rose task.

Scope
Manual verification of the main requirements (REQ1–REQ8) based on the existing Kotlin implementation.

Findings
Two main issues were found:
- Aged Brie decreases in quality instead of increasing (REQ5)
- Backstage Pass increases are incorrect for 10 and 5 days (REQ6)

Next steps
These manual test cases could be automated by me later using Kotlin unit tests
to verify expected vs actual Quality and SellIn values over multiple days.
